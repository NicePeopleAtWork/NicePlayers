If flag titleFromPlaylist it has not been fired, title, duration and urlResource are obtained as before.
20-10-2015	- #YOUB-706		- Biel Conde		- Modified to send duration = 0 in Start when have ads to send it latter in jointime
20-10-2015	- #YOUB-706		- Biel Conde		- On method mediaStartListener(), comment buffer(BUFFER_BEGIN) because when you start the video, he began a buffer and sent the first buffer is always wrong.
