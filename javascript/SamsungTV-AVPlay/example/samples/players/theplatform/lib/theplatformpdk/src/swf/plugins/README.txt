This directory contains source code for plug-ins that ship with PDK.

You are free to use this source code to see how plug-ins work, and how various plug-ins were written.

However, some of these plug-ins use libraries that are not freely distributable, and will not compile if you do not have access to these libraries.

To use the ANT scripts to build these projects, you'll need to copy or incorporate the changes in the "local.properties" file in this directory to a "local.properties" file in your home directory.

E.g., on Windows systems, your home directory is typically "C:\Documents and Settings\{Your User Name}", while on a Mac, your home directory depends on your current configuration.
