This directory contains various sample projects for working with the PDK.  You can freely modify or use any of this code as a starting point for your own applications.

To use the ANT scripts to build these projects, you'll need to copy or incorporate the changes in the "local.properties" file in this directory to a "local.properties" file in your home directory.

E.g., on Windows systems, your home directory is typically "C:\Documents and Settings\{Your User Name}", while on a Mac, your home directory depends on your current configuration.
