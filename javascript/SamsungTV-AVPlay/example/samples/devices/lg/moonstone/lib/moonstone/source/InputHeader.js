/**
	_moon.InputHeader_ is a header that uses an input for the title. While it was
	initially created as an independent subkind of [moon.Header](#moon.Header),
	its unique functionality has been folded back into the latter kind, making the
	current _moon.InputHeader_ simply a _moon.Header_ for which _inputMode_ is set
	to _true_. We continue to offer _moon.InputHeader_ as a separate kind for
	reasons of convenience and backward compatibility.

	The _title_ property is used as the input placeholder, while the _value_
	property contains the contents of the input. Developers may listen for
	_onInputHeaderInput_ and _onInputHeaderChange_ events from the embedded input
	to respond to changes.
