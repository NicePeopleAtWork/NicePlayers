# ExoPlayer #

ExoPlayer is an application level media player for Android. It provides an
alternative to Android’s MediaPlayer API for playing audio and video both
locally and over the Internet. ExoPlayer supports features not currently
supported by Android’s MediaPlayer API, including DASH and SmoothStreaming
adaptive playbacks. Unlike the MediaPlayer API, ExoPlayer is easy to customize
and extend, and can be updated through Play Store application updates.
